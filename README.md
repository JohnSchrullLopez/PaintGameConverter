## Combine Meshes
Combines multiple meshes into one. Used for small props to reduce the amount of textures generated in the Paint Game.

## Generate UVs
Auto-generates UVs to remove any overlap and fit into the 0-1 space.

## Transfer Textures
Transfers textures from unconverted mesh or meshes into a single color and normal texture.
